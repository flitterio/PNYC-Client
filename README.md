## What Is This???
Have you ever found yourself in the middle of New York City, surrounded by buildings, but with no idea where you can use the bathroom? You're not alone. PNYC is the only app around that specializes in finding you the nearest and nicest place in New York City. You can even rate your experience, and add hidden gems on to the map as you find them (like the Chipotle on the coner that will take pity on your unfortunate bladder attack)
